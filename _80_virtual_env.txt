'''
In python it is possible to create virtual enviroments.
Once created, this virtual enviroment keeps isolated from the rest of the
system so it is a perfect test enviroment to avoid damages to the system.
It is possible create these enviroments using different versions of python
even different versions of modules to check if everything works as it should
do.
There are 2 different ways of create a virtual enviroment:
    - venv
    - virtualenv
'''

'''
====================================VENV=====================================
It is the easiest way. This module is implemented directly in python from
version 3.3.

To create a virtual enviroment, execute in a terminal:

    ~python3 -m venv test
        |
        |-> test is the name of the folder where keep all the virtual
            environment files to.

To launch the 'test' virtual environment, inside the folder:

    ~source bin/activate

To stop the virtual enviroment:

    ~deactivate
'''


'''
=============================== VIRTUALENV ====================================
The virtualenv module has some advantages over venv:
    ﻿• It’s faster
    • Easier to extend
    • Can create virtual environments for multiple Python versions
    • Can be upgraded via pip
    • Has a rich programmatic API

Install the viertualenv module is mandatory:

    ~pip install virtualenv

To create a virtual environment:

    ~virtualenv test
        |
        |->'test' is the folder name for the virtual environment

To launch the 'test' virtual environment, inside the folder:

    ~source bin/activate

To stop the virtual enviroment:

    ~deactivate
